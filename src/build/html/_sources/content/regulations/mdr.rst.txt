Medical Device Regulation 
==========================

The EU 2017/745 `MDR`_ provide a framework to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. The regulation set out general requirements for manufacturers to provide their medical devices with a secure design by providing a risk management system, a quality management system, as well as an updated post-market surveillance system.
The regulations require manufacturers to create post-market surveillance systems aiming to gather and analyse relevant data about quality, performance, and safety of a device throughout its entire lifetime to take preventive and corrective actions.
The MDR and IVDR refer to devices that incorporate software or for software that are devices in themselves to be developed and manufactured in accordance with the state of the art in terms of development life cycle, risk management, including information security, verification, and validation.
It also demands manufacturers to set out minimum requirements concerning hardware, IT networks characteristics and IT security measures, including protection against unauthorized access.
